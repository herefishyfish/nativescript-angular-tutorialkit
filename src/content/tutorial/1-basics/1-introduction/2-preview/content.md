# NativeScript Preview

This tutorial **requires** the **NativeScript Preview** app and is all you need to get your app running instantly on your device - no complicated setups or environments needed.

## Why NativeScript Preview?

With NativeScript Preview, you can:


- **Instantly Run Your App**: Simply scan the QR code and watch your app come to life on your mobile device without the need for any local build tools.
- **Instant Feedback**: See changes in real-time as you code. Once you scan the QR code, your updates will appear on your device immediately.
- **Cross-Platform**: Run your app on both Android and iOS with out limitation of the device you're building on.

## Getting Started

To start using NativeScript Preview:

1. **Download the NativeScript Preview App**:  
   Get it from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-preview/id1264484702) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.preview.android).

2. **Scan the QR Code**:  
   Use the Preview app to scan the QR code provided in the tutorial to launch your app instantly on your device.

## Taking It to the Next Level

While NativeScript Preview is great for quickly testing and developing, eventually you may want to start building apps locally to take full advantage of NativeScript’s features, including advanced plugins and native APIs.

To do that, you’ll need to set up your local development environment.

- **Setting up Your Environment**: Follow the official guide for setting up the NativeScript CLI, Android SDK, Xcode (for iOS development), and other necessary tools. You can find the detailed instructions in the [NativeScript Documentation](https://docs.nativescript.org/setup/).

Once you're set up locally, you’ll be able to build, debug, and deploy apps directly from your development machine.

## What You Need to Know

- **No Local Builds with Preview**: With NativeScript Preview, you don’t need to build your project locally, which makes it perfect for fast prototyping.
- **Limitations**: Keep in mind that some advanced plugins or features, may require a full build process that Preview doesn't support.

For now, enjoy the ease of NativeScript Preview, and when you're ready to dive deeper, you'll have all the tools you need to develop locally!
