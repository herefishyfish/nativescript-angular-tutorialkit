## What You'll Learn

As we go along, you'll explore how NativeScript and Angular work together to make mobile app development with web tech easy and powerful.

### Here's a quick peek at what we'll cover:

- **Layouts**: Learn to design responsive UIs with layouts like `StackLayout`, `GridLayout`, and `FlexboxLayout`.
- **UI Components**: Use NativeScript's built-in labels, buttons, images, lists, and more to create interactive app screens.
- **Styling**: Apply CSS to style your app, use themes, and customize everything to fit your vision.
- **Navigation**: Navigate between pages, work with modals, and implement tabs to improve user experience.
- **Device Features**: Tap into native features like the camera, GPS, sensors, and more to make your apps feature-rich.
- **Plugins & Native APIs**: Add extra functionality by using NativeScript plugins or accessing native Android and iOS APIs directly.

## Getting Started

No prior experience with NativeScript is required, but a basic understanding of Angular will be helpful. Each lesson is carefully crafted to build upon the previous ones, ensuring that you develop a solid foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.
