# TextView
While the TextField is ideal for single-line text input, the `TextView` is designed for multi-line text input and display. Here are the key differences and how to use `TextView` in your NativeScript app.

## Key Differences Between TextField and TextView
- Single-line vs. Multi-line:
  - `TextField`: Used for single-line text input.
  - `TextView`: Used for multi-line text input, suitable for longer text like comments or descriptions.
- Scrolling:
  - `TextView` has built-in scrolling when the text exceeds the visible area.
- Behavior:
  - `TextView` allows for text wrapping and accommodates larger amounts of text naturally.
